# Theater Operations

## Stage Procedures

### Theater and Stage Lights
If you go through the office door and immediately open the door to the right, it will take you to the Theater control room. As shown in the image, this is how you would control the lights. Another way to access this area, if already in the theater, go up the stage and behind the podium that room will be on the right.

1) To turn on the stage lights, slide the #1 Master Light Switch up.
2) To turn on the lights within the Theater, press the left buttons marked green 1-4 in any order to turn on the lights. You will see a small red-light indicator when the buttons are pressed.

**If you need to temporarily turn off/on lights, this is how you would control to Theater and stage lights.**

### Projector Use
The left podium is the only working area with an audio and video input source.

1) Tap the tablet to turn on the screen.
2) Press the power button on the screen to lower the projector backdrop.
3) The proper settings to present from HDMI are shown in the left image. "Lectern 2 HDMI" will be selected in red.
4) For a blank screen during your presentation, press the "blank" button. 
- Red means there will not be video output.
- White means it is currently displaying from the HDMI.

**If your laptop does not output HDMI, use the USB-C that should be on the podium, this will allow you to still present it to the projector.**
**The HP NIPR laptops have difficulties displaying with HDMI, if you receive the "Display frequency out of range." message on the projector, the USB-C dock should correct the issue.**

### Microphones
There are multiple microphones available for use, when you power them on, the last digit displayed will be the microphone # associated with the audio system. If not in use, please turn the microphone off to conserve battery.

**Again, if not in use, please TURN OFF the microphone.**

### Ethernet Options for Laptops
To the left of the podium (stage left), before the Theater and stage room, there will be 2 ethernet cables available for use.
- The left port (VT2 01) is "open" or commercial internet.
- The right port (VT2 02) is base NIPR net.

### Out of Frequency Troubleshooting
If you receive an "Out of Frequency" message on the projector, you will most likely have to use the dock to have a better connection and allow your laptop to display to the projector.
It is usually HP laptops that have these connection issues. Follow the picture to "resolve" this issue.

### Power Off
Please turn off power when done using the projector. This is the only way to turn it off.
